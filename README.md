## Configuration
   * #### Configure for cache obj
    
    ```javascript
    var cacheObjOptions = {
            disableCache : false,       
            maxAge : 24*60*60*1000,     // 24 Hours
            removeOnExpire : true,
            deleteOnExpire : false,
            storageMode : "memory",     
            onExpireCallback : null,    // will be available in upcoming version
            recycleFrequency : null,    // will be available in upcoming version
            capacity : null             // will be available in upcoming version
        };
    ```


   * #### Configure for key,value you store
        
    ```javascript
        var cacheKeyOptions = {
                disableCache : false,
                maxAge : null,
                removeOnExpire : true,
                onExpireCallback : null,  // will be available in upcoming version
                recycleFrequency : null   // will be available in upcoming version
            };
    ```
        
## Getting Started

   * #### Include file in project
   
    ```html
            <script src="js-cache.min.js"></script>
    ```
   * #### Create obj
   
    ```javascript
            var cacheObj = jsCache.create("cacheObjName", cacheObjOptions);
    ```
   * #### Cache anything you want in created obj
   
    ```javascript
            cacheObj.put("key", "value", cacheKeyOptions);
    ```
        
   * #### Get saved value anywhere in your project
   
    ```javascript
            cacheObj.get("key");
    ```    

    That's all you need to do.
     You can create multiple objects with different configuration & can store multiple key,values into it.  

## Usage in AngularJS
    jsCache is very good alternative for $cacheFactory in AngularJS.
    
   * #### cache in $http request
   
    Instead of calling create method

    ```javascript
       var cacheObj = jsCache.create("cacheObjName", cacheObjOptions);
    ```
    
    You have to call
    
    ```javascript
        var httpCacheObj = jsCache.createHttpCache("cacheObjName", cacheObjOptions);
    ```

    and pass it to 
    ```javascript
        $http({
            method: 'GET',
            url: "url you provide",
            params: obj,
            cache : httpCacheObj(cacheKeyOptions)
        })
    ```
    
    That's all else angular will take care of saving & retriving data for http calls.
    Except $http api cache procedure is same as mentioned in Getting Started guide.
